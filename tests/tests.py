import unittest

"""
To add a test, copy the below class definition and fill it out depending on what
you need:

class TestSomething(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_something(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 1)

If you add tests to a new file, make sure to import them in __init__.py!

Also, add the following code to your new file so that it can be run as a
standalone script:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

if __name__ == '__main__':
